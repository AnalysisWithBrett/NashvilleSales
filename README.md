# Real Estate Insights Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the readme file for my real estate insights project! This project aimed to simplify complex property data to unlock valuable insights for real estate decision-making. I utilized SQL for data standardization and Tableau for visualization, allowing for comprehensive analysis and visualization of property sale prices.

## Project Details

### Data Standardization with SQL

The project began with the collection of property data from various sources, which was in disparate and inconsistent formats. To address this, I leveraged SQL to standardize the data. Key tasks included:

- Standardizing dates to a consistent format for ease of analysis.
- Separating addresses into distinct columns to enhance data structure.
- Ensuring data uniformity by replacing "Y" and "N" with "Yes" and "No".
- Removing duplicate entries to ensure dataset integrity.
- Streamlining the dataset by eliminating unnecessary columns, focusing solely on essential information.

### Visualization with Tableau

Once the data was cleaned and structured, I employed Tableau for visualization and analysis. Highlights of the visualization process include:

- Designing an interactive dashboard to address critical questions about property sale prices.
- Exploring specific tax districts that consistently command higher sale prices.
- Investigating correlations between the year a property was built and its tax district to reveal development patterns.
- Analyzing average sale prices in each tax district.
- Examining the influence of the number of bedrooms on sale prices across districts.

## Project Impact

This project exemplifies the power of data-driven decision-making in the real estate domain. By effectively cleaning and organizing the data using SQL and transforming it into insightful visualizations with Tableau, I facilitated the comprehension of complex information. This enables buyers, sellers, and investors in the property market to make informed and strategic choices.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this real estate insights project underscores the importance of leveraging data analytics tools to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. By standardizing and visualizing property data, I provided stakeholders with valuable information to support their decision-making processes. As the real estate industry continues to evolve, the integration of data analytics will play an increasingly vital role in driving informed decision-making and optimizing outcomes.

Thank you for exploring this readme file, and I look forward to further discussions on the insights gained from this project.
